# MCMC for Linear Geostatistical Model

During this session [Olatunji](http://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/people/johnsono.html) will be discussing many topics which include, applications of MCMC, variants of MCMC, choice of proposals and priors for new problems, convergence properties, limitations of Metropolis within Gibbs Algorithm and lastly, he will give a demo of how to implement Metropolis within Gibbs sampler for linear geostatistical model.
