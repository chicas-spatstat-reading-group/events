# Maximum likelihood estimation for geostatistical models

This will be a techincal utorial on the implementation of maximum likelihood estimation for geostatistical models. [Emanuele](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/giorgi/) will show how to implement in R the fitting of a linear geostatistical model using analytical expressions for the derivatives.
